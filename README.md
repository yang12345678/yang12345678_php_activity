# PHP Activity

## Overview
This repository comprises the PHP activity designed to be used in tandem with
the VCDEP system, which you can find <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vcdep/vcdep_setup">here</a>. This PHP project is an ecommerce
website for technology gadgets like laptops, phones, smart devices, etc. We
have included a baseline project complete with test cases for Unit and
Integration Testing. This style of project is very useful as a teaching tool
since changes are very visual since students are able to see the change in
their own browser.

Along with this project, we have included a basic activity that your student
can perform with this project and our VCDEP system for teaching Continuous
Delivery concepts.
